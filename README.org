* Jisho Chibi
** Introduction
   This is a minimalistic GUI for jisho searches. It currently can only do a basic word search in the jisho as the API for the jisho only allows that.

   This app is based on the Jisho API provided in this [[https://jisho.org/forum/54fefc1f6e73340b1f160000-is-there-any-kind-of-search-api][forum post]].

   The GUI is a qt web engine, but instead of browsing the jisho website, it makes a small html in the following format to show the meanings.

   #+begin_src html
   <p> JP-WORD (JP-FURIGANA)</p>
   <small><ol>
       <li> en-meanings </li>
   </ol></small>
   #+end_src

   The en-meanings part can contain multiple meanings, and for multiple entries (search results), you can use the buttons on the top to navigate.
